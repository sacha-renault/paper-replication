# EfficientNet - MBConvBlock

This folder contains my implementation of the MBConvBlock for the paper:

- [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946) by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le.
- Also, MBConv was introduced here [MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks
  ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)

## Files

- efficientnet_mbconv.py: Contains the core MBConvBlock class, implementing the mobile inverted bottleneck convolution with squeeze-and-excitation.

## WORK IN PROGRESS

TODOs:

- Tests
- Optimization
