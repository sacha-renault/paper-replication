# PAPER-REPLICATION

A personal collection of research paper implementations from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/). This isn’t about perfect solutions; it’s just my take on bringing ideas from papers into code.

## Paper implemented

- [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](./EfficientNet%20-%20MBConvBlock/) WORK IN PROGRESS
